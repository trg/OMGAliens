This is the Javascript source for the HTML5/Javascript game "OMGALIENS", which uses the Impact framework (http://impactjs.com).

What's included:
 - The Javascript source for the game

What's not included:
 - The Impact game engine. It's a $99 license to own/use which is why it's not included.
 - The image assets for the game.

What you can do:
 - Read the code, learn from it, use snippets of it in your own code.

What you can't do:
 - Pass off the game as your own.  This is why the image assets are not included.

Notes:
 - I haven't documented the code much nor have I gone through and cleaned it up.
